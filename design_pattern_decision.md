The two design pattern decisions used in the project are:

Inheritance and interfaces:

The project contract inherits Ownable.sol from OpenZeppelin to manage ownership.

Access control design patterns:

Ownable.sol is used to make contract ownership more robust and easily verified.

"This function is restricted to the contract's owner" modifier in Migrations.sol
